COVID-19 has made people feel uncomfortable about eating out, and this increase the number of houses where family cook at home. Even though there are a lot of good cookbook, even apps in the world, it is still difficult to find the best recipe which fits each person's situation and get the cooking information we are looking for. For this reason, I created some functions which interact with users and give them perfect information they need by using Python.

**Function 1** - *View information of recipes.*

This is the basic fucntion of cookbook. When users type a name of recipe they want to cook, the program shows the corresponding style, servings, cook time, calories per serving and ingredients.

**Function 2** - *Add a new recipe.*

Not only do people want to read a recipe from a cookbook, but they also want to write and save their own recipes. This function allows to save the information of recipe in the original dataset.

**Function 3** - *View recipes users can make with the ingredients they have in their kitchen*

Sometimes, people want to cook only using ingredients they have in their kitchen. If you type the ingredients you have, the function will tell you what kind of food you can make.

**Function 4** - *View recipes that users can make with the specific ingredients they want to cook*

For some reasons related to health, we want to cook with some specific ingredients sometimes. This function will let you know the list of food cooked with the specific ingredients.

**Function 5** - *View ingredients users need to buy*

If you type the food you want to cook and the ingredients you have, the function will return the list of ingredients you need to buy.

**Function 6** - *Update recipes*

Everyone has different taste. If you want to edit a recipe in the original cookbook, this funtion help you update the recipe.

**Function 7** - *Calculate the total calories*

Currently, a lot of people care about calories intake. This function informs the total calories of  the recipes selected by the users.

**Function 8** - *View the list of recipes with the given total calories and the number of food the users want to cook.

This function informs different combinations of recipes that meet the users' requirement on the calories intake. It asks the total calories intake and the number of recipes. Then, it will return all the list of possible combinations of recipes with their summative calories equal to or less than the target calories intake.
