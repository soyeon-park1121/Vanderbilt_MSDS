# About this Repository
This repository is a collection of work that has been completed while a Master of Data Science student at Vanderbilt University(2020-2022). Below is a brief overview of each project. To see my project, please click .md file in each folder.

<2020 Fall>
**01. Probability and Statistical Inference** - This is a collection of blog posts about probability and statistical inference. It explains concepts and shows how to solve a real-life problem using R. It covers Monte Carlo Error, Discrete Probability Calculations, Bayesian Theorem, Log Transformation, Order Statistics, Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Method of Moments, and Coverage Probability.

**02. Smart Chef** - Using Python, I developed 8 functions interacting with users. Depending on the user's need and situation, the functions return customized cookbook recipe.

**03. Living Environment** - This is a team project to explore the data "2015 U.S. Census". Using R, we analyzed the relationship between each living environment and compared several counties in California, Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York City. Finally, we grouped similar counties using one of machine learning methods, K-means Clustering.
