# 01. Probability and Statistical Inference

**01) Monte Carlo Error** - Explained the concepts of absolute error and relative error when estimating probabilities from simulation. Demonstrated MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MRE(Mean Relative Error) by sample size and the real probability.

**02) Discrete Probability Calculation** - By using Bayesian Theorem and negative binomial distribution, demonstrated the probability related to World Series game in several different situations.

**03) Home Field Advantage** - Compared the probability that a team win the game with and without home field advantage by using simulation.

**04) Log Transformation** - Introduced the concepts of Normal Distribution, Gamma Distribution, and the log distribution for each. Explained Probability Density Function(PDF), Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF), Estimated Cumulative Distribution Function(ECD). Demonstrated that if Xi > 0 for all i, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometri mean using simulation.

**05) Order Statistics** - Demonstrated the order statistis and showed a QQ plot for the simulated data of the median relative to the known sampling distribution of the median.

**06) MLE and MM** - Explained how to use Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE) and Method of Moments(MM) to model Glycohemoglobin and Height of adult females. The data is from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010.

**07) Coverage Probability** - Performed a simulation to calculate the coverage probability of the 95% confidence interval of the median and explained it step by step.

**08) Final Exam** - Covered 10 topics including simulation, probability, Discrete Distribution, Continuous Distribution, Expectation and Variance, Transformation and Sampling Distribution, Estimation of CDF and PDF from data, Sample from an estimated distribution, Inference, Joint Distributions.
